The Lennard Jones Potential is common potential used to model VanderWaals interactions which is expressed as follows,  

<img src="images/vanderwaal.jpg">  

¦Å = the minimum (well depth) of the potential for the interaction between atom i and j.

¦Òij = the collision diameter,at which inter particle potential is zero.

rij = the distance between the particles.

The parameters ¦Å,¦Ò is not given for a specific pair and can be found by using Lorentz-berthelot rules,

The term r-12is called repulsive term, observed at short ranges due to overlapping of electron orbitals. The term r-6describes the attraction at long ranges.
